📐 Math for ML

> "Mathematics is the foundation, Machine Learning is the future."
Welcome to Math for ML – a personal, curated repository where I explore and document the essential mathematical concepts behind Machine Learning. This project serves both as my own learning journal and a helpful resource for others venturing into the world of ML.
